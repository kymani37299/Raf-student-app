App for students of Racunarski fakultet. It provides up to date schedules directly from site,chat,and group chat for all students.
The app needs improved visual aspect.

## Login screen

Login is not that secure right now,all you need is index number and name to login to your account.
It used firebase authentication for login,but there is some problem with permissions with our accounts.
